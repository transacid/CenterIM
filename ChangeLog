0.0.1
-----

Just a first public release of the program.

1.0.0
-----

In this version I made a lot of fixes according to new users' comments. That's
great that so much people deceided to try my program. Here is the list of most
important things that were changed:

- Conflict of the symbol ustat in unistd.h (libc5) and the variable in
  centerICQ.cpp. Fixed. I renamed the variable to usrstat. Noticed by
  Bernhard Sadlowski <sadlowsk@mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de>

- Makefiles in ktools/src and center/ directories didn't work with GNU
  make 3.76 because it appeared to not understand rules like '.cpp.o:'.
  Fixed. All of such rules were changed to '%.o : %.cpp'

- Now centerICQ detects the socket physical disconnection. For example, in
  previous version if you were using Linux system at home and connecting it
  to internet with dial-up ppp account, centerICQ thought it's online even
  after you disconnect from the Internet
    
- Since this version all the outgoing messages are put into the
  center.<uin>.out files in the $(HOME)/.center directory
  
- Some user interface improvements
 
- A very funny bug was fixed. The point is that my ICQ UIN that was added to
  contact list when one started centerICQ for the first time, was a little
  bit incorrect (typing error), my real ICQ UIN is 17502151 :)

- New user registration feature was added

- Now centerICQ send the authorization acceptation immediately after
  receiving of the request from a Mirabilis client

- Now you can make centerICQ not check your mailbox adding 'dontcheckmail'
  parameter into the $(HOME)/.center/config file. Idea of Bernhard
  Sadlowski <sadlowsk@mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de> whose mailbox appeared
  to be too large for scanning every minute :)

- Since this day (1 aug 1999) you always can download the hottest and the
  _latest_ snapshot of the program from its homepage at
  http://konst-linux.i.am/

- CenterICQ now can update your details in the ICQ database

- Now users that are online, offline and users messages from whose have been
  received are highlighted with different colors. It looks much better :)

- Added a nice "History" feature

- Another nice feature. If you don't press any key on one of local consoles
  of your system, centerICQ can automatically set your status to Away and
  then to N/A. Set the time periods with new parameters 'autoAway' and 'autoNA'
  in the ~/.center/config file
  
- 'About' menu item added to global menu invoked by pressing F4
  
- Now centerICQ can handle "ack" packets server reports us about the result of
  sending messages and URLs with. This means that now your messages won't be
  lost on unexpected disconnection from server. Also with this feature you're
  able to write your messages being offline in order for them to be sent when
  you connect to server

---
    Here the detailed changelog begins. A little version number explanation.
    First number means the version number itself, second is how many features
    have been added to it and the third one shows an amount of bugs fixed.
---

1.0.1 - Fixed a segfault that appeared when the user tried to add the same
	uin to the contactlist when it's already exists there
	
1.0.2 - New UIN registration procedure looked bad due to an extra screen
	output (about new mail and status). Fixed

	Now centerICQ will inform me when someone setups it on his computer.
	It just sends a small information message so I could have a little
	program using statistics

1.0.3 - Great! After a day of a perversed sex with debugging tools, setting
	hooks and other things, the wierd segfault has been catched and killed

1.1.3 - Now if you've got any problems with F-keys in the terminal mode, there
	is a possibility to use alternate keys for invoking user, status and
	global menus, they are 'u', 's' and 'g'

1.2.3 - The "Reply" item has been added to the message window that appears
	when reading incoming messages. "Close" item was removed because the
	window is closed with the Esc key

1.3.3 - Now the program handles SIGINT and SIGTERM correctly

	First patch applied :) Its author was Piotr Waskiewicz
	<wasp@linuxfreak.com>. Now centerICQ will inform user about an event
	with a PC speaker beep if the sound device isn't available (busy with
	playing something or something like this). Thank you, Piotr.

1.3.4 - A minor bug fixed. centerICQ played sound on receiving a message from
	a user from ignore list

1.7.6 - Four features added and two bugs fixed.

	Feature 1.
	
	A major interface improvement has been implemented. I wrote new
	ksmalledit class that allows to edit messages using more advanced
	text editor
		
	Feature 2.
	
	Another nice interface improvement. centerICQ doesn't strip \r\n's
	from the received messages anymore, because now it can display such
	messages more correctly. Up and Down arrows scrolls up and down
	the message     you're reading

	Feature 3.
	
	I proceeded with my idea to wrote a general purpose personal
	communications program which will contain not only ICQ client inside.
	So, an internal phonebook had been added. You can find it in the global
	menu invoked with F4 key. Hope, you will find it useful. Maybe, it
	worth integrating with the ICQ contactlist .. don't know. Any
	suggestions are welcome, as usual :)
		
	Feature 4.
		
	Added support for non-80x25 text modes
		
	Bugs.

	A couple of bugs have been fixed. First was related to adding users
	with empty 'nickname' field into the contact list: after restarting
	centerICQ they had been displayed incorrectly. And the second one
	was that the program played 'received msg/url/etc ..' sound on
	receiving messages from users in ignore list

	Some corrections.
		
	Since this version contactlist is updated on the screen even if you're
	working with menus such as phonebook, change status, history, etc.

	Misc.

	Also, file HOWTO-thank-me was added into the program package. Maybe
	someone will really help me with a thing I wrote there ... Will see

1.10.7 -
	Bugs fixed:

	There was a bug with receiving contacts from users, centerICQ thought
	that all the received contacts had uins the same as uin of sender.

	And some minor changes made.

	Features added:

	It was impossible to abort updating user's details procedure until
	it isn't finished. Now you're able to do that, so let's think it's a
	a feature :)

	Now all the files created by centerICQ in the .center directory have
	-rw------- permissions to be more secure :) So now all of your
	conversations are hidden from courious eyes of another users :)

	"-a" command line parameter added. It forces centerICQ to draw its
	windows using ascii characters '+', '|' and '-'

2.0.0
-----

First major feature that's implemented in this version is support for icq
protocol version 5. It will allow me to implement such useful thing as file
transfer and chat, I'm going to make it soon.

Next, a lot of user interface improvements. Parameters for users searching
and updating user's info now are entered with a menu. Also, 'user information'
window was improved, now it allows to view more info and has quite useful menu
in bottom line of the window.

Another thing that's improved in user information displaying, was saving
all the retreived info in separate disk file. So now there is no need to
retreive it every time you choose 'user info' in menu.

Sure, some bugs were fixed. Due to the fixes connection became more stable and
it doesn't break because of protocol implementation mistakes.


PS: As usual I'd like you to take a look at HOWTO-thank-me file. Who knows,
    maybe you're the one who's able to make it.


2.2.1
-----

First... Grhm. Happy New Year! Cheers :)

AutoAWAY and AutoNA options now work ok. There were some problems detecting
the time of local user's inactivity, but after implementing that another way
it became great :)

Rewritten some code related to contact list management, now it looks much
better.

Now centericq package is proudly distributed with its own autoconf script ;)

'Edit ignore list' fascility added to the program interface (see global menu).

2.3.3
-----

Fixed a minor bug in the source code that caused problems compiling
the program.

Fixed a bug that caused centericq to switch status to n/a when running
on a remote console (/dev/ttypXX for example).

Previous version seems to be the most buggy one. One more bug has
been fixed, it caused centericq not to auto-accept authorization requests
and not to inform a user that someone has added him to a contact list.

Now the centericq windows use all the screen height and width (if more
than 80).

Now available in RPM format :)

2.7.4
-----

As the ktools library was rewritten and optimized, centerICQ became faster.
For example, messages history now pops up a little bit quicker, etc. A lot
of code improvements, in general :)

Text message editor was totally rewritten. It now allows to enter more than
one space between words and has some useful facilities.

History reading and sorting operation was speed up.

ESC is not an exit key anymore. To quit the program you should now use 'q'.

Phonebook was obsoleted.

Ignore list didn't work at all. Fixed.

2.11.5
------

Now it's possible to view messages history when writing a message.

Makefile.in has changed in order to make the installation more flexible. Now
the program can be ./configured and installed with any ${prefix}. Proposed by
Alexandr D. Kanevskiy <kad@dc.ukrtel.net>, the author of BlackCat Linux
distribution.

If you're such a emacs fan like Felix Natter <f.natter@ndh.net> ;), now you
can enjoy emacs key bindings support in centericq. All needed to turn the
feature on is to add 'emacs' string to your ~/.center/config file.

Sometimes centerICQ sent messages twice. Fixed.

Now it's possible to send a message to several users on your list.
"^P multiple" option was added to the "send message" dialog.

Messages forwarding feature added.

2.12.6
------

Ctrl-L now refreshes the screen contents.

To cancel an action or close a window now you gotta press ESC
twice (like in Midnigh Commander).

Splitting messages longer than 450 characters now works ok. There were some
problems in previous versions.

3.0.0
-----

Completely rewritten from scratch. Its advantages are:

  + nice C++ design
  + written with motor, http://konst.org.ua/motor
  + use of icqlib that extends icq related features with file
    transfers, handling wider sets of users' details, etc

Note for those who upgrade from previous versions. Binary file now called
centericq, not center like it was before. Shared files (wav's) are now held
in /usr/local/share/centericq/, not in /usr/local/share/center/ Also,
~/.center directory is no longer used, ~/.centericq is created instead.

3.2.3
-----

Some code clean-ups made. There were some problems with compiling the program
on some systems.

User interface improved. Now quick keyboard help is displayed in the status
line.

Now centericq can hide offline users when contact list is displayed.

Ctrl-C (sigint) is now blocked since it's dangerously close to Ctrl-X
used to send an event.

"Quick config options" improved.

Fixed segfault on sending long messages.

3.7.3
-----

A little patch to the icqlib has been made. Now centericq can receive messages
and URLs from people with mirabilis clients sent to several recipients.

Ported to FreeBSD at last! Thanks to
Gregory Edigaroff <greg@Thing-Fish.Kharkov.NET> for a FreeBSD 4.0 CD :)

German .po translation by Florian Müller" <flo@flo.s-s-f.de> included into
the distribution.

Now centericq doesn't automatically switch your status to Away or N/A when you
are invisible.

Visible list feature added.

History reading has been speed-up.

Now it's possible to view users' details with alt-? when writing a message.

3.13.3
------

At last contacts receiving feature was implemented in this re-write. It was
supported in 2.x.x series, but had been lost. Now it's ok.

ICQ server address is now configurable.

Update user info feature now works great. It's possible to update gender
and languages fields in the ICQ database.

Now ":)" is printed next to nickname of a user having a birthday.

Countries are sorted alphabetically in the selection box invoked from
the "update details" dialog.

It's now possible to view affiliations and background in users' details.

Quoting a message on reply is now possible.

SOCKS proxy support added. Thanks to Sir Kot <cyrilm@maris.ru> for the patch.

Quick contact search feature added. Now you can type nickname to search
for a user in contact list. This new feature is activated with Alt-S (or
ESC-S) key.

Some minor interface bugs have been fixed.

3.20.5
------

"Add to the list" button added to the authorization request dialog.

Now it's possible to specify sounds for two additional kinds of events:
someone's appearing online and receiving a contact.

Added a command line parameter "--ascii" or "-a" to make centericq
draw all the dialog frames, boxes and other interface stuff with
non-pseudographical characters.

Centericq doesn't allow to send empty messages anymore.

Now, when sending a long (more than 450 characters) message, centericq
checks whether if it's possible to send it with a direct TCP/IP link.
If so, it doesn't split the message as it did before.

Fixed a bug that caused impossiblity to receive messages longer than
512 bytes.

The "telnet <centericq tcp port number>" bug fixed. If you telneted to a
port listened by centericq and typed random characters it caused centericq
segfault.

"Remember ICQ password" item has been added to the configuration dialog.
Set to "no" it causes centericq not to hold it in the config file,
thus the password is asked every time you launch the program.

Online users are now sorted by status.

Now it's possible to reply on a message from history.

Anti-spam feature added. If you set this option to "yes" in the
configuration dialog, no messages will be accepted from people not
on your contact list.

Applied the file transfer segfaults fixing patch for icqlib by Jindrich
Makovicka <makovick@kmlinux.fjfi.cvut.cz>. He appeared to be a great
contributor having many intresting ideas, so I hope we'll work together
a lot. Keep it up, Jindrich!

Ported to OpenBSD. Thanks to Peter Valchev <pvalchev@toxiclinux.org> for
the patch.

3.22.8
------

Centericq didn't remember the "anti-spam" setting after restart. Fixed.

A segfault caused sometimes by receiving and viewing histories
containing empty msgs was fixed.

Now it's possible to enter the quickfind mode with "/" key.

Contact list is now sorted by "who-last-send-an-event" criteria :)

Czech translation by Jindrich Makovicka has been added.

Unsent messages counter in the top of the screen has been added.

Developed and packaged with the new version of motor 2.15.7 which is
available at http://konst.org.ua/motor/ ;)

3.29.12
-------

Fixed a bug with the sound files path being incorrectly auto-written
into the ~/.centericq/sounds file.

The keypress handling routine was impoved. It caused centericq not to
handle the ICQ protocol events if a single ESC was pressed.

Fixed a segfault on contacts receiving.

Now it's possible to open a received URL with a browser (netscape by
default). The command line for URL opening can be changed in the
~/.centericq/actions file.

Also centericq can now open URLs found in messages and user info. Just
press F2 to see the list of URLs.

Some cosmetic changes were made.

Hungarian translation by Pásztor György <pasztor@linux.gyakg.u-szeged.hu>
was added.

Now centericq displays both local and real IP addresses of a user.

Visible list was fixed.

Cancelled messages are now got postponed. You can continue editing them
next time you open a send message box for the user.

Substring search in history was implemented.

Date and time representation format is now taken from current locale
settings.

QuickFind feature invoked with Alt-S now works in multiple contact
selection mode as well as in the contact list.

QuickFind is now case insensitive.

3.34.15
-------

Fixed a minor bug in the icq communications module that caused some
problems sending files.

The default "openurl" action in ~/.centericq/actions was improved.

The GNU copyright notice was added to every source file as the Vice
President of FSF requested me with e-mail message (no shit :)

Now centericq displays a warning on running the second copy of centericq
with the same UIN in parallel.

Fixed a wierd bug caused some messages' not appearing on history.

Manual page centericq.1 was included to the package.

All the control keys are now blocked with the standard ncurses raw()
call. So now you can easily mix up Ctrl-X and Ctrl-Z without any problem
:)

An ability to turn off local mailbox checking was added.

3.35.22
-------

Sclerosis again. Centericq didn't remember the "local mailbox checking"
setting after restart. Fixed.

Italian translation by Leandro Noferini <lnoferin@cybervalley.org> has
been added.

New "green" and "schlich" color schemes can now be found under the
contrib/ subdir.

icqlib forgot to make a koi8-win1251 translation in user info fields. Fixed.

If centericq didn't find its ~/.centericq/config file it removed whole
contact list by mistake. Fixed.

After setting the "sound device" setting to "off" the sound remained until
a user restarted the program.

The "Details" and "Add" buttons in the "Find/add users" dialog caused
segfaults and hangs on empty lists.

All the received messages in history had an hour forward time in the
"sent" field.

Good news for Russian speaking centericq users. I've patched icqlib so
that now it does translate comments for received URLs from win1251
into koi8.

Basic Hebrew and Arabic languages support was added. To enable it,
first, install fribidi library, and then run ./configure --with-fribidi
before running make. You can download the library from
http://imagic.weizmann.ac.il/~dov/freesw/FriBidi
