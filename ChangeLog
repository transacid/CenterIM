0.0.1
-----

Just a first public release of the program.

1.0.0
-----

In this version I made a lot of fixes according to new users' comments. That's
great that so much people deceided to try my program. Here is the list of most
important things that were changed:

- Conflict of the symbol ustat in unistd.h (libc5) and the variable in
  centerICQ.cpp. Fixed. I renamed the variable to usrstat. Noticed by
  Bernhard Sadlowski <sadlowsk@mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de>

- Makefiles in ktools/src and center/ directories didn't work with GNU
  make 3.76 because it appeared to not understand rules like '.cpp.o:'.
  Fixed. All of such rules were changed to '%.o : %.cpp'

- Now centerICQ detects the socket physical disconnection. For example, in
  previous version if you were using Linux system at home and connecting it
  to internet with dial-up ppp account, centerICQ thought it's online even
  after you disconnect from the Internet
    
- Since this version all the outgoing messages are put into the
  center.<uin>.out files in the $(HOME)/.center directory
  
- Some user interface improvements
 
- A very funny bug was fixed. The point is that my ICQ UIN that was added to
  contact list when one started centerICQ for the first time, was a little
  bit incorrect (typing error), my real ICQ UIN is 17502151 :)

- New user registration feature was added

- Now centerICQ send the authorization acceptation immediately after
  receiving of the request from a Mirabilis client

- Now you can make centerICQ not check your mailbox adding 'dontcheckmail'
  parameter into the $(HOME)/.center/config file. Idea of Bernhard
  Sadlowski <sadlowsk@mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de> whose mailbox appeared
  to be too large for scanning every minute :)

- Since this day (1 aug 1999) you always can download the hottest and the
  _latest_ snapshot of the program from its homepage at
  http://konst-linux.i.am/

- CenterICQ now can update your details in the ICQ database

- Now users that are online, offline and users messages from whose have been
  received are highlighted with different colors. It looks much better :)

- Added a nice "History" feature

- Another nice feature. If you don't press any key on one of local consoles
  of your system, centerICQ can automatically set your status to Away and
  then to N/A. Set the time periods with new parameters 'autoAway' and 'autoNA'
  in the ~/.center/config file
  
- 'About' menu item added to global menu invoked by pressing F4
  
- Now centerICQ can handle "ack" packets server reports us about the result of
  sending messages and URLs with. This means that now your messages won't be
  lost on unexpected disconnection from server. Also with this feature you're
  able to write your messages being offline in order for them to be sent when
  you connect to server

---
    Here the detailed changelog begins. A little version number explanation.
    First number means the version number itself, second is how many features
    have been added to it and the third one shows an amount of bugs fixed.
---

1.0.1 - Fixed a segfault that appeared when the user tried to add the same
	uin to the contactlist when it's already exists there
	
1.0.2 - New UIN registration procedure looked bad due to an extra screen
	output (about new mail and status). Fixed

	Now centerICQ will inform me when someone setups it on his computer.
	It just sends a small information message so I could have a little
	program using statistics

1.0.3 - Great! After a day of a perversed sex with debugging tools, setting
	hooks and other things, the wierd segfault has been catched and killed

1.1.3 - Now if you've got any problems with F-keys in the terminal mode, there
	is a possibility to use alternate keys for invoking user, status and
	global menus, they are 'u', 's' and 'g'

1.2.3 - The "Reply" item has been added to the message window that appears
	when reading incoming messages. "Close" item was removed because the
	window is closed with the Esc key

1.3.3 - Now the program handles SIGINT and SIGTERM correctly

	First patch applied :) Its author was Piotr Waskiewicz
	<wasp@linuxfreak.com>. Now centerICQ will inform user about an event
	with a PC speaker beep if the sound device isn't available (busy with
	playing something or something like this). Thank you, Piotr.

1.3.4 - A minor bug fixed. centerICQ played sound on receiving a message from
	a user from ignore list

1.7.6 - Four features added and two bugs fixed.

	Feature 1.
	
	A major interface improvement has been implemented. I wrote new
	ksmalledit class that allows to edit messages using more advanced
	text editor
		
	Feature 2.
	
	Another nice interface improvement. centerICQ doesn't strip \r\n's
	from the received messages anymore, because now it can display such
	messages more correctly. Up and Down arrows scrolls up and down
	the message     you're reading

	Feature 3.
	
	I proceeded with my idea to wrote a general purpose personal
	communications program which will contain not only ICQ client inside.
	So, an internal phonebook had been added. You can find it in the global
	menu invoked with F4 key. Hope, you will find it useful. Maybe, it
	worth integrating with the ICQ contactlist .. don't know. Any
	suggestions are welcome, as usual :)
		
	Feature 4.
		
	Added support for non-80x25 text modes
		
	Bugs.

	A couple of bugs have been fixed. First was related to adding users
	with empty 'nickname' field into the contact list: after restarting
	centerICQ they had been displayed incorrectly. And the second one
	was that the program played 'received msg/url/etc ..' sound on
	receiving messages from users in ignore list

	Some corrections.
		
	Since this version contactlist is updated on the screen even if you're
	working with menus such as phonebook, change status, history, etc.

	Misc.

	Also, file HOWTO-thank-me was added into the program package. Maybe
	someone will really help me with a thing I wrote there ... Will see

1.10.7 -
	Bugs fixed:

	There was a bug with receiving contacts from users, centerICQ thought
	that all the received contacts had uins the same as uin of sender.

	And some minor changes made.

	Features added:

	It was impossible to abort updating user's details procedure until
	it isn't finished. Now you're able to do that, so let's think it's a
	a feature :)

	Now all the files created by centerICQ in the .center directory have
	-rw------- permissions to be more secure :) So now all of your
	conversations are hidden from courious eyes of another users :)

	"-a" command line parameter added. It forces centerICQ to draw its
	windows using ascii characters '+', '|' and '-'

2.0.0
-----

First major feature that's implemented in this version is support for icq
protocol version 5. It will allow me to implement such useful thing as file
transfer and chat, I'm going to make it soon.

Next, a lot of user interface improvements. Parameters for users searching
and updating user's info now are entered with a menu. Also, 'user information'
window was improved, now it allows to view more info and has quite useful menu
in bottom line of the window.

Another thing that's improved in user information displaying, was saving
all the retreived info in separate disk file. So now there is no need to
retreive it every time you choose 'user info' in menu.

Sure, some bugs were fixed. Due to the fixes connection became more stable and
it doesn't break because of protocol implementation mistakes.


PS: As usual I'd like you to take a look at HOWTO-thank-me file. Who knows,
    maybe you're the one who's able to make it.


2.2.1
-----

First... Grhm. Happy New Year! Cheers :)

AutoAWAY and AutoNA options now work ok. There were some problems detecting
the time of local user's inactivity, but after implementing that another way
it became great :)

Rewritten some code related to contact list management, now it looks much
better.

Now centericq package is proudly distributed with its own autoconf script ;)

'Edit ignore list' fascility added to the program interface (see global menu).

2.3.3
-----

Fixed a minor bug in the source code that caused problems compiling
the program.

Fixed a bug that caused centericq to switch status to n/a when running
on a remote console (/dev/ttypXX for example).

Previous version seems to be the most buggy one. One more bug has
been fixed, it caused centericq not to auto-accept authorization requests
and not to inform a user that someone has added him to a contact list.

Now the centericq windows use all the screen height and width (if more
than 80).

Now available in RPM format :)

2.7.4
-----

As the ktools library was rewritten and optimized, centerICQ became faster.
For example, messages history now pops up a little bit quicker, etc. A lot
of code improvements, in general :)

Text message editor was totally rewritten. It now allows to enter more than
one space between words and has some useful facilities.

History reading and sorting operation was speed up.

ESC is not an exit key anymore. To quit the program you should now use 'q'.

Phonebook was obsoleted.

Ignore list didn't work at all. Fixed.

2.11.5
------

Now it's possible to view messages history when writing a message.

Makefile.in has changed in order to make the installation more flexible. Now
the program can be ./configured and installed with any ${prefix}. Proposed by
Alexandr D. Kanevskiy <kad@dc.ukrtel.net>, the author of BlackCat Linux
distribution.

If you're such a emacs fan like Felix Natter <f.natter@ndh.net> ;), now you
can enjoy emacs key bindings support in centericq. All needed to turn the
feature on is to add 'emacs' string to your ~/.center/config file.

Sometimes centerICQ sent messages twice. Fixed.

Now it's possible to send a message to several users on your list.
"^P multiple" option was added to the "send message" dialog.

Messages forwarding feature added.

2.12.6
------

Ctrl-L now refreshes the screen contents.

To cancel an action or close a window now you gotta press ESC
twice (like in Midnigh Commander).

Splitting messages longer than 450 characters now works ok. There were some
problems in previous versions.

3.0.0
-----

Completely rewritten from scratch. Its advantages are:

  + nice C++ design
  + written with motor, http://konst.org.ua/motor
  + use of icqlib that extends icq related features with file
    transfers, handling wider sets of users' details, etc

Note for those who upgrade from previous versions. Binary file now called
centericq, not center like it was before. Shared files (wav's) are now held
in /usr/local/share/centericq/, not in /usr/local/share/center/ Also,
~/.center directory is no longer used, ~/.centericq is created instead.

3.2.3
-----

Some code clean-ups made. There were some problems with compiling the program
on some systems.

User interface improved. Now quick keyboard help is displayed in the status
line.

Now centericq can hide offline users when contact list is displayed.

Ctrl-C (sigint) is now blocked since it's dangerously close to Ctrl-X
used to send an event.

"Quick config options" improved.

Fixed segfault on sending long messages.

3.7.3
-----

A little patch to the icqlib has been made. Now centericq can receive messages
and URLs from people with mirabilis clients sent to several recipients.

Ported to FreeBSD at last! Thanks to
Gregory Edigaroff <greg@Thing-Fish.Kharkov.NET> for a FreeBSD 4.0 CD :)

German .po translation by Florian Müller" <flo@flo.s-s-f.de> included into
the distribution.

Now centericq doesn't automatically switch your status to Away or N/A when you
are invisible.

Visible list feature added.

History reading has been speed-up.

Now it's possible to view users' details with alt-? when writing a message.

3.13.3
------

At last contacts receiving feature was implemented in this re-write. It was
supported in 2.x.x series, but had been lost. Now it's ok.

ICQ server address is now configurable.

Update user info feature now works great. It's possible to update gender
and languages fields in the ICQ database.

Now ":)" is printed next to nickname of a user having a birthday.

Countries are sorted alphabetically in the selection box invoked from
the "update details" dialog.

It's now possible to view affiliations and background in users' details.

Quoting a message on reply is now possible.

SOCKS proxy support added. Thanks to Sir Kot <cyrilm@maris.ru> for the patch.

Quick contact search feature added. Now you can type nickname to search
for a user in contact list. This new feature is activated with Alt-S (or
ESC-S) key.

Some minor interface bugs have been fixed.

3.20.5
------

"Add to the list" button added to the authorization request dialog.

Now it's possible to specify sounds for two additional kinds of events:
someone's appearing online and receiving a contact.

Added a command line parameter "--ascii" or "-a" to make centericq
draw all the dialog frames, boxes and other interface stuff with
non-pseudographical characters.

Centericq doesn't allow to send empty messages anymore.

Now, when sending a long (more than 450 characters) message, centericq
checks whether if it's possible to send it with a direct TCP/IP link.
If so, it doesn't split the message as it did before.

Fixed a bug that caused impossiblity to receive messages longer than
512 bytes.

The "telnet <centericq tcp port number>" bug fixed. If you telneted to a
port listened by centericq and typed random characters it caused centericq
segfault.

"Remember ICQ password" item has been added to the configuration dialog.
Set to "no" it causes centericq not to hold it in the config file,
thus the password is asked every time you launch the program.

Online users are now sorted by status.

Now it's possible to reply on a message from history.

Anti-spam feature added. If you set this option to "yes" in the
configuration dialog, no messages will be accepted from people not
on your contact list.

Applied the file transfer segfaults fixing patch for icqlib by Jindrich
Makovicka <makovick@kmlinux.fjfi.cvut.cz>. He appeared to be a great
contributor having many intresting ideas, so I hope we'll work together
a lot. Keep it up, Jindrich!

Ported to OpenBSD. Thanks to Peter Valchev <pvalchev@toxiclinux.org> for
the patch.

3.22.8
------

Centericq didn't remember the "anti-spam" setting after restart. Fixed.

A segfault caused sometimes by receiving and viewing histories
containing empty msgs was fixed.

Now it's possible to enter the quickfind mode with "/" key.

Contact list is now sorted by "who-last-send-an-event" criteria :)

Czech translation by Jindrich Makovicka has been added.

Unsent messages counter in the top of the screen has been added.

Developed and packaged with the new version of motor 2.15.7 which is
available at http://konst.org.ua/motor/ ;)

3.29.12
-------

Fixed a bug with the sound files path being incorrectly auto-written
into the ~/.centericq/sounds file.

The keypress handling routine was impoved. It caused centericq not to
handle the ICQ protocol events if a single ESC was pressed.

Fixed a segfault on contacts receiving.

Now it's possible to open a received URL with a browser (netscape by
default). The command line for URL opening can be changed in the
~/.centericq/actions file.

Also centericq can now open URLs found in messages and user info. Just
press F2 to see the list of URLs.

Some cosmetic changes were made.

Hungarian translation by Pásztor György <pasztor@linux.gyakg.u-szeged.hu>
was added.

Now centericq displays both local and real IP addresses of a user.

Visible list was fixed.

Cancelled messages are now got postponed. You can continue editing them
next time you open a send message box for the user.

Substring search in history was implemented.

Date and time representation format is now taken from current locale
settings.

QuickFind feature invoked with Alt-S now works in multiple contact
selection mode as well as in the contact list.

QuickFind is now case insensitive.

3.34.15
-------

Fixed a minor bug in the icq communications module that caused some
problems sending files.

The default "openurl" action in ~/.centericq/actions was improved.

The GNU copyright notice was added to every source file as the Vice
President of FSF requested me with e-mail message (no shit :)

Now centericq displays a warning on running the second copy of centericq
with the same UIN in parallel.

Fixed a wierd bug caused some messages' not appearing on history.

Manual page centericq.1 was included to the package.

All the control keys are now blocked with the standard ncurses raw()
call. So now you can easily mix up Ctrl-X and Ctrl-Z without any problem
:)

An ability to turn off local mailbox checking was added.

3.35.22
-------

Sclerosis again. Centericq didn't remember the "local mailbox checking"
setting after restart. Fixed.

Italian translation by Leandro Noferini <lnoferin@cybervalley.org> has
been added.

New "green" and "schlich" color schemes can now be found under the
contrib/ subdir.

icqlib forgot to make a koi8-win1251 translation in user info fields. Fixed.

If centericq didn't find its ~/.centericq/config file it removed whole
contact list by mistake. Fixed.

After setting the "sound device" setting to "off" the sound remained until
a user restarted the program.

The "Details" and "Add" buttons in the "Find/add users" dialog caused
segfaults and hangs on empty lists.

All the received messages in history had an hour forward time in the
"sent" field.

Good news for Russian speaking centericq users. I've patched icqlib so
that now it does translate comments for received URLs from win1251
into koi8.

Basic Hebrew and Arabic languages support was added. To enable it,
first, install fribidi library, and then run ./configure --with-fribidi
before running make. You can download the library from
http://imagic.weizmann.ac.il/~dov/freesw/FriBidi

4.0.0
------

Ok. I'm glad this release is finally ready. I tried hard to add some
features I needed myself and was asked to make a zillon times. Though
now I need to arrange my life in another country I recently moved to, I
couldn't help keeping on coding one of my favourite developments :)
Thus, read on.

Fixed some problems centericq source had with C++ compilers that have no
support for namespaces.

Applied patch by Pavel Gubin <pg@cedar.ie.tusur.ru> which fixes the bug
causing centericq not to return from autoAway/autoNA mode when only one
of the timeouts is set.

Message editor was fixed a little bit. Ctrl-right/left to walk through
words hadn't worked.

--enable-locales-fix parameter was added to ./configure scipt. It's very
useful when you have an old version of libc with twisted iscntrl(), but
still need to be able to see Chinese characters :)

The previous version didn't respect "prefix" autoconf setting. Share and
locale directories always pointed into /usr/local/share/. Fixed.

The centericq man page hadn't been installed along with other stuff.
Fixed.

Now centericq is able to react on xterm window resize event.

The program is not compatible with GCC >= 3.0.0. You can easily use the
new compiler to build it.

An ability to send all events through server added. You can turn it on
with corresponding item of the "Config options" dialog.

Contact groups support was added at last. I enjoy it a lot now :) It's
off by default. To enable it go to the "Config options" dialog.

Spanish PO along with docs in this language was added.

"Next" button in incoming contacts window didn't work properly
sometimes. Fixed.

It's now possible to update information in the "Work" section. Had to
patch icqlib.

Since I was dealing with icqlib, I couldn't help making other useful
modifications. For example, I implemented White page search support. You
can see it as a bunch of additional parameters in the "Find/add users"
dialog.

"Clear" button was added to the "Find/add" dialog.

"Wrong password" situation is now tracked in icqlib, and thus reported
by centericq.

Invisible list was implemented.

Contacts sending feature was implemented.

Offline contacts show/hide command now has a hotkey - F5.

Now centericq (my own branch of icqlib to be exact) sets user's timezone
properly. And also it's now possible to view user's local time in the
"user info" dialog.

A first version of contact list and history converting perl script was
included into distribution. Now only licq is supported.

4.1.0
-----

cicqconv script now has support for kxicq2 and gnomeicu.

"Send contacts" wasn't displayed in the context menu. Fixed.

"Add to contact list" for "Not in list" contacts now asks a group.

Shortcuts were added to dialogs.

All the input lines how have history which is possible to invoke with
Alt-H.

Finally, a great piece of news. As Mirabilis servers have problems with
v7 protocol, all the Linux ICQ clients work very unstable nowdays. Some
messages never arrive, or delivered an incredible amount of times,
search eventually appears not to work, etc. Until we have a good open
source library for icq2000, I decided to pay some attention to other IM
protocols. It resulted in implementing a support for Yahoo in this
version of the program. A lot of interface related code has been
changed, so bugs are quite possible. Registering new UIN, updating
details, etc, now look a bit different, but still intuitive, so that
you'll have no major problems with it. Enjoy. In the next version
support for MSN is expected.

4.2.0
-----

This version as promised adds MSN protocol support. It's expected to be
buggy, but releasing it in this shape will help me to fix them faster.
Just don't forget to report if you saw something wierd (not including
knocking under your bed :)

Some information for Yahoo and MSN contacts is filled in now to make it
easy to launch a browser in order to see details.

Screen updating routines work more efficiently now.

Multiple contact selection box now has color highlight for different IM
flavours.

Now it's possible to associate sounds with particular contacts from any
IM network.

Non-icq contacts were renamed to "info cards", and now to add one the
"Find/add" dialog should be used. Also, an info card can be placed to
any group (if you have such a mode on).

Cicqsync script should work better now. Specially under FreeBSD where it
didn't work at all.

4.2.1
-----

Ok, it was late yesterday, I tried to fix something in the night, but it
resulted to program's bailing out with segfault on every attempt to browse
events history. So this is a bugfix.

Passwords remembering worked horribly. Fixed.

4.5.0
-----

This release adds a very important improvement. ICQ communications were
moved to the library of ickle client, written by Barnaby Gray
<barnaby@beedesign.co.uk>. Since the library supports the icq2000
protocol, this version centericq doesn't loose messages unlike previous
ones. Also it's now possible to send SMSes. Though, the library is not
complete yet, so features such as finding users, updating details,
sending contacts and files are now gone. Temporary.

Another major rewrite the event processing system suffered. Now events
are processed in a nicer way, and the code is what I can now be proud
about, again, unlike previous versions.

Because of the mentioned above changes some parts of centericq's user
interface things were changed. I don't feel like remembering all of them
now, so just take a look yourself. What's for sure, they made the whole
thing only better.

4.5.1
-----

Centericq now can display more users' ICQ details than it ever could.
Now it can show gender, IP address, spoken languages, time zone and
local time, interest names and categories, background info, etc. This
part is finally ready.

Another improvement of the ICQ module affected finding users, an
extremely useful feature which was disabled for a while because of
moving centericq to the new protocol and the nice engine named
libicq2000. The latter now supports white pages, and so does centericq
:)

And finally, it's possible to update your own ICQ info with the "Update
user details" item in the account manager dialog.

Sound actions associated with e-mail arrival events didn't work. Fixed.

Account manager now re-reads IM logins information after changing
something in the appropriate dialog.

Another small bug was fixed. After editing details of any user on the
list mannualy set nicknames which were to be shown on the contact list
were reset to initial values.

Now it's possible to specify another ICQ server in the registration and
account manager dialogs.

Invisible mode works well now.

The FAQ was updated from the centericq.de fan club site :-)

AutoAway/AutoNA modes should work well now.

A useful and very wanted feature was added. Now centericq can make a log
file in which events such as users' going offline and online, as well as
events receiption and sending are logged. It's possible to turn on with
the "Configuration" dialog.

User group modes 1 and 2 were implemented. First one means users are
arranged into groups on the first level nodes in the tree, and second is
visa versa, e.g. online/offline has upper position.

Fixed a bug in libicq2000 which caused receiving only empty messages in
authoriation requests.

Now centericq (and libicq2000 too) can receive e-mail express and "you
were added" messages from other users.

The only known problem of this release, actually of the ICQ part, is
that the version of libicq2000 included is not release one, and it has a
bug related to accept status. I mean, if you send a message to a buddy
who's using the Windows client and his status is occupied or N/A, the
event won't reach him. And also it still segfaults on xterm resize event
sometimes. Wierd.

4.6.0
-----

Fixed a segfault used to occur every time on selecting "Find/add
user(s)" item in the global menu under RedHat 6.2.

Log messages reporting status change had old and new statuses swapped.
Fixed.

Fixed incorrect update of zip code when changes were made manually in
"Edit users" or update self details dialogs.

Sounds for user online event type didn't work.

Whitepages search was fixed a little bit, for the majority of age ranges
were not respected.

Away messages support was added. It's now possible both set your own or
fetch someone's else away message with centericq. Consult the README
file for more details.

Socks proxy support related options were removed from the configuration
dialog until this feature is really supported.

URLs starting with "https://" are now fetched along with others from
messages, users' details, and in other places where URL extraction is
supported.

The README file was extended with e-mail express and away messages
descriptions.

Fixed a bug caused inability to fetch self details when our own UIN was
on the contact list.

4.6.5
-----

Another really nice feature was added. Now it's possible to define
external actions to be performed when centericq receives an event. Quite
a flexible configuration file allows to execute actions depending on IM
protocol, event type and your current status. This feature makes it
possible to setup auto-answering, Elizatalk (a bot to make fun with your
friends), remote control, events forwarding and whatever else your
fantasy can say. More information you'll find in the README.

Added a bunch of command line options for putting events to the outgoing
queue from the command line. Consult the man page and README for more
information.

Now it's possible to specify server address for MSN protocol.

Fixed a bug that resulted in interests and background information
doubling after every "edit details" attempt with users on your contact
list.

It was impossible to update own ICQ nickname. Fixed.

Now timestamps are attached to "new mail arrived" messages in the log
window.

Applied a patch for correct processing of Cyrillic letters for MSN by
Walery Studennikov <despair@sama.ru>

Applied a patch for transparent background support in some X terminals
and switching status simultaneously for all the IM protocols together,
by W.J. van der Laan <gnufnork@hetdigitalegat.nl>

Yes, the previous item means exactly that "sexy" transparent backgrounds
in various terminals are supported now. It's implemented in the
following way. Along with the standard color names there is the one
named "transparent" which you can use in the colorscheme files.

Size of contact list and log window are now proportional to the terminal
size. Also they're re-calculated on every window resize event, which
make a good use in various X terms.

The log window and status bar contents are now saved during the terminal
resize re-draws.

Fixed the segfault on terminal window resize. Proud to say now it's
almost uncrashable. Anyway, if you saw it segfaulting in such a
situation, drop me a line.

Sometimes during UIN registration centericq consumed up to 100% of CPU
time. Fixed.

Trying to specify server for icq resulted in segfault. Fixed.

Finally sending SMSes through E-mail gateways supported by ICQ was
implemented. I made a contribution to the libicq2000 source code in
order to get it done, and another parameter called "SMTP server" was
added to the centericq configuration dialog.

Fixed memory leaks that were occuring every time history view was
invoked.

Fixed the libicq2000 bug resulted in inability to accept authorization
requests.

4.6.9
-----

Now when free disk space becomes less than 10k centericq goes offline,
refuses to connect and doesn't touch configuration files to not to lose
any data.

A compilation error with "twisted" versions of iconv was fixed by adding
another check to configure.

The "Next" button was added to the history. It actually goes back, so it's
called so to conform the UI look.

Weird behaviour of the group mode 2 when there is only one contact list
group defined was fixed.

When available, iconv is used for translation between koi8 and cp1251
codepages instead of the internal routine.

Support for AIM TOC protocol was added. This means now centericq supports
four IM flavours, which makes it even more useful tool. Now, looking at
the centericq main screen I find myself a real schizophrenic with four
IM "avatars". So there is another slogan for the program "centericq - the
power of your shizo" :)

HDD access was reduced by not reading away messages every second, how it
was before. So now owners of laptops should have no worries about batteries,
for centericq will allow their boxes to go to power saving mode.

Fixed a bug with user's details fetching, resulted into weird behaviour
caused by new-line character in any fields on the information.

This version also introduces the "relaxed" re-connect strategy. Every time
it cannot automatically re-connect to an IM service, the try period is
icreased by half of its previous value. This is made so that "turboing"
situations are recovered without any user's intervention.

Invalid username or/and password situation is now tracked and reported
in the Yahoo! engine.

Finally, a bug caused centericq to freeze (for protocols' activities)
after "Ctrl-L" was fixed with a patch sent by Sergey A.
Kogan <kogan@omskelecom.ru>

4.7.1
-----

Seems like I just cannot stop adding support for protocols. Thus,
support for IRC was implemented in this version. It doesn't (yet?)
support talking on channels and intended only for private messaging.
Though, you can enter channels to be visible for other users staying on
them. Channels are controlled with the "Channel manager" dialog which
can be ivoked from the account manager. It's also possible to fetch a
list of users on channels with the find/add dialog.

Since libicq2000 now does support visible and invisible lists, so does
centericq.

Now centericq can ask away messages when you change your IM status. This
behaviour is controlled with the respective option of the configuration
dialog.

Feature to change current IM status from the command line was added.

The auto-away/auto-N/A behaved weird on remotely connected sessions.
Fixed.

All the lists of contacts such as contact list, search results, multiple
recipients selection now highlight users from various networks with
appropriate colors and have the quick-find feature which is possible to
be activate with "/" or alt-s.

ICQ invisible status of contacts wasn't shown. Fixed.

The bug which made it impossible to send SMS-es to oneself from the
command line was fixed.

Applied the collapsable groups patch from Bertram Bourdrez
<bourdrez@casema.net>. So now a contact list group can be collapsed or
expanded by pressing Enter on its header.

Now it's possible to move groups up and down the contact list with the
group manager dialog.

It's also now possible to send messages to found users from the find
results list without adding them to the contact list.

The crash with the "Broken pipe" message which happened after network
interface's going down was fixed.

The existing but not documented before -b parameter was finally
documented both in README and in the man page. It allows to specify
another base directory for the IM details and makes it possible to use
different identities under the same UNIX account.

4.7.2
-----

Chat messaging mode was implemented. Along with the text being typed you
can see history of previous messages without invoking the history
facility. It's possible to turn it on with the configuration dialog.

Fixed a bug resulted in eating up disk space when it's not possible to
re-send events for quite a long time (several days, let's say). It kept
on adding newline characters after each attempt.

E-mail and name substring search options were added to the irc find
mode.

The "Move to group.." item was removed from the context menu of a user
which is not in list. Only "Add to list" can be used there.

Away messages didn't get recoded from koi8 to win1251, fixed.

Switching IM status to offline (_) from the command line was broken.
Fixed.

4.7.5
-----

Birthday reminders are now sent to the contact list as system messages
from users.

An ability to store and load sets of search information under profiles
was added to the "Find/add" dialog.

IRC search only by e-mail without channel specification was added.

A segfault was fixed in the MSN part. It happened when a hotmail box was
cleared entirely through their web interface.

4.7.7
-----

Centericq now compiles well with the new 3.1 version of GCC compiler.

Fixed a bug resulted into incorrect recipient choosing after performing
mass history message forward from the chat mode.

The "Channel manager" dialog was extended so that it allowed to chat on
IRC channels. To add a channel to the list you have to set "Show on the
contact list" for it.

ICQ events sent to users with status "Occupied" or "DND" were lost.
Fixed. Missed the workaround in the libicq2000.

The cicqsync script now refuses to work with CVS version <= 1.10

Bugs in the Yahoo! engine were fixed. They resulted into adding contacts
with strange names to the list. Eventually the Yahoo! support in
centericq became unusable because of some minor changes in the contact
list transmission protocol part. It was a really stupid bug of the Yahoo
library the program uses, and I immediately fixed it.

In the IRC module there was a problem with not detecting the case of
inability to join a channel, and it also was silent when a user was
kicked. Fixed, so that now it's detected and reported to the contact
list.

4.7.8
-----

Now the source should compile well on Solaris OS. Thanks to Jochen
Kmietsch <jochen.kmietsch@tu-clausthal.de> for initial portings efforts
and to Lion Templin <lion@leonine.com> for providing an account on a
Solaris box.

Fixed a possible buffer overflow in the MSN e-mail notification
processing code of the respective module. Thanks to KF
<dotslash@snosoft.com> for finding and reporting it.

The cicqconv migration script now does also support micq. Thanks to
Artur Komarov <artur@emd.ru>

The centericq's own notification messages class used for such events as
birthday reminders, away messages and other stuff, was separated from
usual messages. That was done to avoid external handler's reacting on
such messages like they were received from one of your contacts.

The yahoo library used by the program was changed to the one of new
generation. It would not happen unless the yahoo guys would leave their
old protocol working. So one day centericq's yahoo support just became
outdated and unusable. Anyway, now it's back, up and running, with
several new features such as settable server address and port, and
conferencing support.

As usual, several cosmetic bugs were fixed.

4.8.0
-----

Finally people started sending patches. This version includes a patch
from Julien LEMOINE <julien@3rd.dyndns.org> that fixed several fribidi
and gcc 3.1 specific problems. Also Josh McIver <jmmc@flaglink.com> has
sent a patch that made centericq report when one of your Yahoo! contacts
starts or stops typing on his side.

Fixed a bug that led to segfalut when you pressed "r" on a group header.

Fixed a bug in Yahoo! that resulted into inability to remove contacts in
some situations. Just after they were deleted they rised from the dead
again. It doesn't happen anymore.

There was a problem with the chat mode, when a lot of people asked me
how to accept an authorizaiton request. Now it's easy, upon receiving it
will pop-up in a usual windowed mode.

The find/add dialog in the IRC mode was extended with a new option,
called "Joined since the last check only". It will show only users
joined since your last find/add request. It helps to view only those who
entered a channel recently.

The authorization request displaying dialog was extended with a new
"User info" button. It allows to view user's details before you accept a
request.

4.8.2
-----

Fixed the "r" key bug again. Shouldn't segfault anymore on pressing it
on a group header.

The ICQ part suffered a lot of changes that brought several major
improvements. This happened after yours sincerelly decided to contribute
a bunch of code to the libicq2000 project which can be found at
http://libicq2000.sf.net/. So, here we go with the new features of the
ICQ module.

Random chat feature support. Now it's possible to search for a random
chat partner in a specific group with the "Find/add dialog" as well as
to announce your own availability with the "Update user info" item under
the "irc" tab in the account manager dialog.

Finally, a long-awaited feature got implemented. Server-based contact
lists are now supported by centericq. By default, all the add and remove
operations on your contact list are reflected server-side. Also, as soon
as you login the contacts stored on the ICQ server get auto-added to
your local list. Though it's possible to disable this, by setting the
value of the "Store contact list server-side" in the "Update user info"
dialog for ICQ to "no". To synchronize your local contact list with the
remote one, i.e. to add the server-side missing items, use the
"Syncronize contact list" item in the account manager dialog.

Also, having a look at the newly implemented features of libicq2000, I
found something missed in centericq. So, since this version centericq is
able to perform keywords-based search, receive webpager events and
control the visibility of your current ICQ status on the web.

There were user interface related changes as well. Visible and invisible
contacts are highlighted in a special way on the contact list now. Read
the README file for more details.

When compiled with fribidi, it's now possible to disable displaying of
right-to-left text by switching off the appropriate item in the
configuration dialog.

The event sending general-purpose routine was improved so that remote
DoS/flood protection on the remove IM servers doesn't turn on because of
hudge mass-sendings. Now messages that overflow the limit get postponed
and sent in another 5 seconds.

The configuration changes, as well as users' details, group settings and
some other stuff is now saved immediately once it gets modified, and not
only on exit, like it was before. Thanks to Wolfram
Schlich <wolfram@schlich.org> for pointing this out.

Fixed a bug that caused Yahoo! users raise from the dead (re-appear on
the list) when a user attempted to delete a contact which had been added
in the same session, i.e. without logging off.

4.8.3
-----

Bug-fixes in the AIM part. These include the repaired feature to remove
contacts from the contact list as well as the connect procedure that got
broken on some boxes. Now the both things must work fine. So AIM support
works even on the Jeff Covey's box right now.

The command line parameter "--version" has been added.

The modifications in the previous version broke the command-line sending
SMS to oneself feature. During fixing this one, I thought about another
useful feature.. See below.

Now it's possible to send SMSes to any phone number from the command
line with the -n (--number) parameter. Also, if the ICQ login
information is specified, it's possible to send SMSes to contact of any
kind on your list through the ICQ network. This means that if a phone
number is entered for a Yahoo, MSN or infocard contact, you're now able
to send them an SMS with centericq.

The contact list synchronization feature was modified, so that now it
doesn't send authorization requests automatically. It appeared that the
ICQ server allows to store contacts server-side without it ;) Though
instead of requesting it automatically, it's now possible to request one
manually with the corresponding menu item that was added recently.

Several interface related issues noticed were fixed.

4.8.4
-----

Sending and receiving contacts feature was implemented.

The contacts selection box in visible/invisible list adding mode now
contains only items from the networks that support the feature. So far
it's only ICQ, though.

IRC NickServ authentification was implemented. The optional password
field was added which can be filled up if necessary.

Now, if the "Edit away message on status change" is enabled and all the
away messages are the same for all the protocols that support the
feature, it is displayed in the message edit box.

In the MSN the whole contact list is now read as soon as login is
performed. Friendly nicks are substituted.

Added two types of external actions that are executed before sending and
receiving events. It gives users a possibility to process messages
before they get to contactlist or history. Can be useful for on-fly
ecryption/decryption as well as for other aims.

The "Find/add users" dialog in the MSN mode was extended with one more
parameter that allows to browse users who have us on their contact
lists.

MSN contact-lists synchronization feature was added.

The "Prev" button was added to the event view dialog in the history
browsing mode, so that it's possible to navigate the history in both
directions.

4.8.5
-----

Fixed a bug that made all the yahoo, msn and irc contacts have female
gender.

A cosmetic bug was fixed. It used to appear on attempts to send SMSes.
Nickname shown on the list changed to UIN and then quickly back to the
nick.

IRC "version" requests now answers with the correct value of the version
of centericq being used.

IRC ping command was added. Possible to be invoked from the context (f2)
menu for any IRC contact who is online.

It's now possible to change MSN friendly nick from the "Account manager"
dialog.

For IRC channels there is now a possibility to join or leave them from
the f2 menu without a need to go to the "Channel manager" dialog.
Pressing "?" on a channel item shows the list of channel users.

File transfers in IRC were implemented.

A small change in the local mailbox check mechanism. New messages
announced now only if the mailbox grown, to avoid announcements when
some messages get deleted.

A patch to get rid of recently appeared problems with AIM was applied.

4.8.6
-----

Now all the "Not in list" buddies in Yahoo, AIM and MSN networks are
removed from the remote list where they get temporarely added in order
to not to appear next time on the persistent list.

Fixed the segfault problem in the Yahoo module. The crashes were caused
by the latest version of the official client on remote.

Fixed several nicknames-related bugs in the MSN module. Now friendly
nicknames with spaces are shown correctly, as well as it's possible to
set a nickname for yourself that contains spaces. Also the nicknames on
the list get updated as soon as a remote changes their nick.

The program now compiles and hopefully works well on the MacOS X/Darwin
platform.

4.8.7
-----

Several problems with Cyrillic characters were eliminated. It was
impossible to perform ICQ White Pages searches using Cyrillic letters.
Also when receiving messages with the letters used along with characters
unknown for the koi8-r codepage, it resulted into showing it in bare
cp1251. Also a guessing routine was written in order to be able to
receive Yahoo! messages written both in cp1251 and utf-8 (the recent
"improvement" by Yahoo).

A patch written by Andreas Winge <d98winge@dtek.chalmers.se> was
applied. The changes from it make it possible to join password-protected
channels on the IRC network.

"On fly" auto-reloading of configuration files was implemented, to
eliminate the need to restart the program every time the files are
changed. Centericq periodically checks them whether any modifications
took place. If so, they get re-read. The ones that get re-read now are:
sounds, colorscheme, actions and external. 

The Yahoo! module was extended with the the feature to send and receive
files, view conference members and creating own conferences. Before it
was only possible to join to conferences being created by others. Also
it's now possible to fetch custom status messages in the network.

4.8.8
-----

Fixed a bug resulted into inability to read events received through the
e-mail gateway and the ICQ web pager.

The MSN contact list items' duplication problem was fixed.

Support for the 6th protocol - Jabber, was added. It's already possible
to send and receive messages, read away messages, maintain contact list
and register new nicks. I heard a lot about the standard, but then after
studying it a little, I didn't get disappointed, for it's really nicely
designed. So, centericq is now delivering the power of the free
communication standards to all the console freaks (like myself).

The build problem under the Redhat 8.0 distribution was fixed.

The "Not in list" contact list node is handled in a nicer way now. When
centericq is unable to read the status of a contact which is not
included into the permanent contact list, it just doesn't show it
eliminating cases when an offline contact is shown online just because
it's not on the list.

A long-awaited interface feature to open an event in the full-screen
mode was added. Check out the F9 key in the message view mode.

4.8.9
-----

Due to the effort of Barnaby Gray, our fellow libicq2000 author, who
eliminated the need for the libsigc++ in order to compile his library,
centericq now does neither. I.e. we can count minus one additional
requirement. Cheers.

The F9 and F2 keys that execute full-screenizing of an event and showing
its URLs respectively, now work in the chat mode too, acting with the
latest incoming event from the remote user.

Wrong Jabber IDs specification used to lead to segfaults. Fixed.

The "Find/add users" dialog was improved. In the searach by nick/UIN mode
now it's possible to send messages to users without adding them to the
permanent contact list.

A segfault was fixed which appeared on pressing F9 in user's details
view mode.

Jabber users directory search was implemented as well as the
invisibility along with the visible and invisible lists support.

The Jabber does now have support for the SSL connections with the
server.

Several interface related fixes were also made.

4.9.0
-----

The FAQ document was extended with some more entries.

The Jabber module was improved. Now it also supports registration on
various agents that have the feature, as well as fetching others' and
modifying your own vcard information. Groupchat was added, and nicknames
in roster get updated as soon as you change them on the centericq
contact list.

The UI approach to channels and conferences was changed dramatically.
There is no "IRC Channel manager" anymore. It was replaced with the
"Join channel/conference" dialog which is invoked from the F4/g-menu.
All other operations with channels are done from the contact list
directly, with the help of commands mentioned in the F2-menu when the
hostkey is pressed on the corresponding entry.

The MSN module migrated to the MSN library written by Meredydd Luff
<m_luff@wincoll.ac.uk>. It's way better than the previous one, it's more
stable and doesn't hang waiting for data to be received, supports typing
notifications and extended new mail notifications.

4.9.1
-----

Now the "Reject" button in the Jabber authorization request view window
works. It appeared that it wasn't enough just to ignore such a request,
because in this case it keeps on coming next time you log in.

In the "Configuration" dialog it's now possible to specify a port range
for peer-to-peer connections. Since only the ICQ module in the program
supports such kind of communications, obviously only its port listening
mechanism will be affected.

Jabber contact list synchronization was implemented. Let me remind you
here that in centericq synchronization means a process of reflecting the
local contact list remotely, e.g. if there are contacts that are on your
local list in centericq, but they're not stored server-side, they get
uploaded remotely as soon as you run the respective procedure.

MSN phone information fetching was implemented.

Another discovered feature of the ICQ network was that if a remote user
is not online currently, then a message for him which gets stored
server-side is cut to 450 bytes. Centericq now has a workaround for such
a situation: it splits offline messages into pieces 450 bytes each.

The password change option was implemented in ICQ and AIM modules. Look
at the "Update details" dialogs.

MSN kept on repeating "you were added" messages. Fixed.

Users on the ignore list should have been ignored even if they sent add
notifications or authorization requests, but they were not. Now they are.

Jabber registration caused segfault if there was a space in the "Login"
field. Now, the "wrong jabber id" problem is reported in such a
situation.

When you had your own Jabber contact on centericq contact list, it
wasn't possible to update details. Fixed.

Adding and reading information about server-side contacts when they're
read as a bunch of the first connect with centericq is now done slower,
with necessary timeouts and stuff. Because of this workaround the server
is supposed not to kick us out because of flood anymore.

4.9.2
-----

A problem resulted into ignoring bold attributes on the colorscheme file
auto-re-reading was fixed.

The SENDER_NICK environment variable for scripts executed on events
related to MSN contacts had been set incorrectly. Fixed.

Several small patches from Julien LEMOINE <speedblue@debian.org>, a
Debian developer, were applied.

Now the centericq build procedure can automatically find and use the
alternative SSL library, called GnuTLS. Old versions of OpenSSL called
SSLeay will work with centericq now too.

User info "manual" external actions were implemented, so that now it's
possible to define various operations to be performed with users on your
contact list. You can bind the host(1) command for ICQ contacts to
comfortably lookup their domain names, for instance. More info in the
README chapter 9.3.6.

The external actions definitions file format was extended with the
new "nowait" option which makes centericq not to wait the action
code to finish.

Since external actions can also process outgoing messages (%pre-send),
the environment variables for scripts were renamed from SENDER_* to
CONTACT_*.

The Jabber module was modified so that now it treats correctly all the
data encoded in UTF-8, including nicknames in roster, user information,
and so on.

The centericq configuration now gets saved on receiving the SIGTERM
signal. Useful if you don't wanna lose your recent settings on reboot.

Shells others than /bin/sh didn't work in external actions. Fixed.

In the adding to visible/invisible list selection box contacts that are
already on the list are not shown anymore.

4.9.3
-----

Glib is not needed to build the program anymore.

The old nickname didn't appear in the change nickname input line which
was invoked from the Account manager dialog.

Logging became more configurable. Now from the configuration dialog it's
possible to enable/disable such facilities like log messages timestamping,
showing of users going online and offline and "user is typing"
notifications.

The --bind command parameter was added. Using it it's possible to specify
a custom IP centericq should use for outgoing connections.

Several patches from Julien LEMOINE <speedblue@debian.org> were applied.
Among them there was emacs key bindings config option.

The join/part IRC messages are now visible, as well as channel topics.

MSN status related problems were fixed. Like when user set "one the phone"
or "lunch" status centericq used to show them as being offline.

Minor problems in the Jabber module were fixed. Also, now the program shows
a list of users on a channel.

A patch from Mark Verboom <mark@verboom.net> was applied. It allows to
enable chat mode only for specified protocols.

It's possible to enable Russian translation only for selected protocols
now as well.

Eliminated a bunch of warnings in the kkconsui and libicq2000 code.
Speeded up the compilation a little bit.

Ported to Cygwin. Now it's possible to build centericq as a native Win32
application.

4.9.4
-----

The Russian win1251/koi8 translation configuration parameter got enabled
every time centericq started, even if it was turned off before.

The find/add users dialog didn't allow entering nicknames, which made it
impossible to add yahoo and aim contacts.

Timestamps in the log window got duplicated on every terminal resize
event.

Several other minor problems were fixed.

4.9.5
-----

If you're against M$, don't wanna use Yahoo! or find Jabber too
complicated, since this version all of your religious reasons should be
satisfied. You can also save compile time, money you'd spend on new HDD
(since the current one is not enough for the centericq binary), etc :)
What's it all about? Well, it's about build-time disabling of not
desired protocols. For example, if you use the --disable-yahoo parameter
with the centericq's configure script the Yahoo! module won't be
compiled in. The same is valid for all the other modules except for ICQ.

Internal RSS reader module was implemented. You can now easily add a
feed to your list from the menu, and stay tuned on news at your
favourite sites. See the README for details.

Users who set their status to "away" on the MSN network appeared offline
in centericq. Fixed.

Jabber online/offline events were not shown in the log window. Fixed
this one too.

Fixed a bug because of which centericq couldn't connect to networks
other than ICQ when the --bind parameter was used.

ICQ away messages requests are now shown in the log window.

SMSes in Russian now work (with operators which support Cyrillic of
course).

Auto-wrap was disabled in the internal editor, so now it's possible to
paste text and it will not get screwed up.

Jabber conferences were fixed. Actually, a small workaround was added
for a weirdness of jabber.com server.

Jabber passwords hash authentification was enabled.

4.9.6
-----

The internal RSS parser suffered some changes that enabled it to undestand
the RDF dialect as well as CDATA values. Some problems related to fetching
all the records on every check were fixed.

RSS checking delays are now specified in minutes, not in hours.

The "Reply" button was removed that used to appear in the message box
when reading RSS records.

Correct redirect processing was implemented in the HTTP module used to fetch
RSS documents.

HTTP proxy support was added. So far it's used only for RSS fetching.

History lastreads checking was improved. Now centericq shouldn't show the
unread messages mark for contacts you communicated with during some clock
skews.

Auto-reconnect appeared not to work for the ICQ protocol. Fixed.

It's now possible to join a Jabber conference by its JID, without a need
for a service to be registered on the server. Example:
"jdev@conference.jabber.org" in the "Name/Title" field.

Since Jabber IDs are not case sensitive, centericq treats JIDs written with
capital and small letters the same way.

The status change window was improved. Now it has the "All protocol" item on
the top along with newly added "Already logged in only".

The cicqconv contact list conversion utility was extended with ICQ list
support for Trillian written by Vassilios Karakoidas <bkarak@aueb.gr>.

Jabber authentification became smarter. If server doesn't support digest
authentification, it's not tried anymore. The point was that the new
digest practice made it impossible to login into server which didn't
support md5 digest auth. Fixed.

HTTP proxy support for fetching RSS feeds was fixed. It used to segfault
the application in some situation.

4.9.7
-----

The "away message was requested" log message for the ICQ protocol was
removed. The point is that receiving such a packet doesn't always mean
someone requested it manually, but it happens very often that client
programs fetch away messages on their own. Like when your status is
away.

The problem with the Yahoo! protocol which appeared recently was fixed
with updating libyahoo2 to a newer version and hacking into it the fix
code borrowed from GAIM.

Applied a patch from Daniel Lublin <daniel@lublin.se> which makes it
possible to define colors for incoming and outgoing history items
separately.

Sending messages by simply pressing the Enter key was implemented.
Protocols list is configurable. So if you'd like to have such a feature,
let's say, for irc, but leave icq as it's now, you can easily do it from
the configuration dialog.

Fixed several problems that used to appear when only one IM protocol was
configured. For instance, it was unable to change the status. Thanks to
Justin Scott for bug-report.

Vassilios Karakoidas sent a patch for cicqconv which added converting
some more Trillian contact items into centericq.

Several grouping related problems were fixed. Sometimes groups got
messed up. Now it shouldn't happen anymore.

"User is typing" messages were removed from the log window. So now you
can see a "T" letter in the brackets sometimes appearing there instead
of online status.

The "Default charset" parameter was added to the configuration dialog.
It's a replacement for the hard-coded #define used to specify the
explicitely used charset before.

Several build problems on RH9 were fixed. The fix also eliminated
problems ones had using the cicqsync script to fetch daily CVS updates.
So if you had problems with it, just give it another try. And in case
there are some other problems, consider reading this:
http://centericq.de/docs/faq.php

And now there is the most sick piece of centericq news ever. Since this
very version, it supports LiveJournal. LiveJournal is an amazing blogs
community which uses its own fully open source technology. It also has a
client-server protocol, so I though we could make use of it in the small
proggy. Connecting is simple: if you have an LJ account, just go to the
account manager and introduce your login and password there. As soon as
you login, you'll have a brightly colorized online item named
<your_username>@lj, which you can use to send LJ posts. Also there will
be your friends' journals automatically imported as RSS feeds. More
details about LiveJournal at http://www.livejournal.com/

Donating via webmoney is now supported. For those of you who for some
reasons don't have a possibility to register a paypal account, but still
want to reward me for my hard work, can make a donation via webmoney. A
sum proportional to happiness and satisfaction you have of using
centericq, can be sent to the webmoney purse Z846530103960. I also want
to remind you that the old good paypal is still functional, and you can
find a direct link to donations at the centericq homepage at
http://thekonst.net/centericq/. Thank you for your support, guys!

4.9.8
-----

MSN support was removed because of possible legal problems with the new
protocol.

LiveJournal posting parameters were added. Now it's possible to specify
subject, mood, music and flags such as whether to allow comments or not,
etc. It will be possible to detect music being played by the next
version of orpheus (http://thekonst.net/orpheus) automatically ;)

A set of LJ friends management features was added. Now you can add
friends to your account directly from the "find/add" dialog. Also,
deleting friends from the centericq contact list automatically sends
respetives requests to the main server. Another neat feature is that
centericq will now inform you when someone adds or removes you from
their friend lists. Centericq does also keep track of birthdays of your
LJ friends.

Line breaks in LJ friend feed now look better.

AIM buddy list is now automatically imported on every login.

The Jabber module now works better with transports to other networks.

On some systems codepages didn't work properly unless it was specified
exactly like "utf-8". So I replaced all the occurences of "utf8" with
"utf-8".

Yahoo! weird disconnects were fixed by applying a patch made by Chris
Drake.

A patch by Andreas Winge to enable the "/me" command for IRC was
applied.

Applied a patch from BenV which enables qmail Maildirs checking.

Some weird memory leak problems seem to be gone now.

A segfault on some of wrong RSS feeds was fixed.

When everything but icq was disabled on build it, the linker couldn't
find some symbols. Fixed that.

4.9.9
-----

Yahoo! search was implemented. Now it's possible to find users by
keywords and names from centericq.

Yahoo! and Jabber server-side groups are now reflected on the contact
list. Also, any change made on the list being online is immediately
reflected on the server. This is something I'm planning to do with all
the supported protocols soon.

LJ support was improved. Now messages that were written offline are
stored and the get posted ok. Also, it's now possible to post comments
on LJ postings of your friends without a need to launch a web browser.
Also, the find/add dialog for LJ was extended with the "Show users who
have you on their list" option.

A small bug in the LJ posting dialog was fixed. Now there are three
values of the "security" field, just like it should be.

The RDF support got broken somehow in the previous release. Fixed.

Crash on removing of Yahoo! users was fixed.

IRC didn't remove nicks of users who were kicked from the channel
members lists.

Jabber registration attempts gave a connection error message. Fixed.

Talking about Jabber, now it's possible to specify the value of the
priority parameter for a session. Thanks to Mikael Berthe for the patch.

Applied a small patch from Mikael Berthe to enable hotkeys in the status
selection menu. The hot keys are status codes, like 'o', 'a', 'n', etc.

Passwords are not stored anymore in the input lines history (invoked
with Alt-H).

Since now, the annoying Yahoo! color codes are removed from messages.

Fixed a rare bug which led to auto-adding of people who drop-in into
your contact list on Yahoo! after the program got crashed.

4.9.10
------

Survived another Yahoo! protocol change. Thanks to Lucas Nussbaum and his patch
for gaim that I used to update centericq's branch of libyahoo2.

Moving of contacts between groups made easy due to the brand new "Mass group
move" feature which you can find in the general actions menu.

E-mail addresses used to disappear from ICQ details. Fixed.

Applied patch by Ivan Daniluk to enable HTTP connecting through proxies. For
RSS only. Now, if you specify proxy address in the form of
user:passwd@host:port, necessary authentification will be performed.

During the build process on BSD-like systems (including MacOS X) configure
couldn't find iconv. Fixed that.

Importing of LJ friends can now be disabled in the Account manager dialog.

Contact list synchronization feature was removed, because due to some specific
things of IM severs sometimes it didn't go smoothly and provoked too much
weird questions from users.

Some Yahoo! improvements related to Cyrillic and big-endian machines support
were made.

IRC /raw command was implemented.

RSS displaying was improved. Now URLs of links and images are shown in
text of feed items.

LJ comments posting was removed, because it didn't work due to some recent
protocol changes.

The "Force check" item for RSS feeds got its own shortcut. The magic key is
"c".

4.9.11
------

MSN protocol is back.

LiveJournal can now use the http proxy setting from configuration. Patch by
Ivan Daniluk.

Welcome another IM in the centericq family. Support for the Polish Gadu-Gadu
was added. Can be disabled like any other using --disable-gg command line
parameter for configure. Though better just try it out.

Server-side groups were implemented for the ICQ protocol. Now, I know it can
be kinda flustrating to move your contacts into different groups again, but
this way you'll have them arranged nicely on the server, not only locally
in your centericq contact list. It must make you a little happier about it,
as well as the fact that we have the "mass move" function.

libiconv linking problems were fixed.

A problem with Jabber conferences was fixed. In the "Join Channel" dialog
the service textual description was used instead of chat service name.

Codepages conversion was extended. Now it's possible to specify charsets
from and to which you'd like your messages to be (de-/en-)coded. Must be of
great use for those languages that use different charsets on different
platforms, just like koi8 and cp1251 for Russian.

The -v command line parameter now lists protocols that were enabled on
the build time.

ICQ password change was removed, for it's broken.

A bug was fixed that caused centericq not to work properly with eJabberd
servers.

The cicqsync script was improved, so that it works on *BSD and Solaris
systems now.

Search load bug was fixed. It caused some searches to load incorrectly.

The configure script now checks if SSL support is on before enabling the
MSN module. SSL is really necessary for MSN to function, so there is no
joke about it.

Now it's possible to use wildcards for protocols in the sounds configuration
file. Patch by Marc Thoben.

"Sent on" timestamps are now displayed for protocols that support it. Patch
by by Heitham Omar.

Now it's possible to scroll a message in the full-screen mode invoked with F9.

Another useful option was added to the configuration dialog. Now you can
make your non-IM contacts such as rss feeds and infocards show up as being
online all the time. The option is called "Always online non-IM contacts"
and it's possible to chose protocols to be shown always online.

Configurable key bindings patch by Daniel Kraus was applied.

4.9.12
------

On MacOS and Sun systems there was a problem using --disable-proto
parameters of the configure script. Been there, fixed that.

It was impossible to turn on character set conversion for the LJ
protocol. Fixed.

Another nasty bug was related to the new configurable keybindings
feature. Default configuration files were not created on a fresh run and
also in case the program couldn't find them, so it was a real trouble.

Now, invoking the multi-contacts selection dialog, you'll see groups and
be able to select/deselect whole groups as well.

The support for Gadu-gadu did also suffer some important changes. Now
one can change their info on the network and search for other users. A
new yet important feature was added: now, if there is libjpeg installed
in the system, it's possible to register new UINs.

The "Enter key sends" feature lost its functionality in the previous
version. Fixed.

MSN used to crash on long messages. Fixed as well.

Jabber module now sends keepalive packets from time to time.

4.10.0
------

Problems with displaying national characters that used to happen on some
systems were fixed.

Centericq was moved over the new C++ library for MSN written by Mark
Rowe, a 18 years old guy from the New Zealand. His libmsn is really
cool.

Applied patch by Iulian Ciorascu that made Jabber not to block when
establishing an SSL connection.

A small patch by Daniel Lublin was applied. It makes centericq save
postponed messages. Also if a contact has an unfinished message, a ">"
characters appears next to the nickname on the contact list.

Centericq now announces the "can receive RTF messages" flag to the ICQ
server. This fixes the old Cyrillic+Latin characters problem, when the
former become question-marks. Thanks to Sergei Dolmatov for helping me
implement and test this one.

When trying to send an event from command-line and there is no
destination contact on the contact list, it is automatically added now.
This behavious was chosen instead of the old one when centericq refused
to send events to contacts that were not on the contact list.

The LiveJournal part now brings the friends-only items too. They are
fetched using the HTTP digest authentification mechanism. I added that
to my HTTPClient class, which you can use in your GNU programs also,
since it's quite a nice and quite advanced implementation of the
protocol.

On Yahoo! and MSN, when another simultaneous login is detected centericq
doesn't ever try to reconnect.

The Yahoo! protocol suffered another auth scheme change, after which all
open-source clients became non-functional again. Applied a patch to
libyahoo2, looks good so far.

Several minor interface-related bugs were fixed.

4.11.0
------

HTTP CONNECT method is now supported. This means that if this feature is
enabled on your HTTP proxy server, you can use it to connect to your
favourite IM servers. You can also specify a user/pass pair if your
proxy requires authentification.

Applied a patch by Alexander Kanevskiy that fixed a weird behaviour of
the LJ import friend option in the accounts dialog.

In the multi-contact selection window not all contacts were shown unless
arranging users into groups was on in the configuration dialog.

GG used to disconnect when setting its status to N/A. Fixed that.

When LJ import friends feature was off deleting LJ friends from the list
was reflected server-side. Not it happens only if LJ friend
synchronization is on.

Now centericq only saves postponed messages if they contain at least one
character other than space, tab or a line-feed.

Centericq used to hang right at the start on some machines. Fixed that.

Sending Cyrillic letters over Yahoo! seems to be fixed now.

Centericq now sets its own title text in xterm and screen. The aim of
the messages in the title is to inform the user upon events receiving
and such.

Applied a patch by shaky that introduced status modes with descriptions
into GG.

RSS feed contact-list items now support specifying of login and password
for basic HTTP authorization.

The AOL TOC firetalk library was updated. Some major bugs were fixed by
this update. Cheers.

Jabber registration got broken in the previous version because of the
Jabber non-blocking connection patch. It has been fixed by the patch
author in this version :)

4.12.0
------

Fixed an MSN group management problem. Libmsn din't send a space character,
so group operations had no effect or led to disconnects.

With no SSL library found during the build the source failed to compile.
Fixed that.

Jabber server messages used to come from a nick that was similar to
the server name with an "@" sign at the end. That was unnecesary, so it's
not added anymore.

Added the --no-xtitles (-T) commmand line parameter, which disables
changing window titles in xterm and screen.

In LJ, if the whole friends name list grew more than 512, the LJ contact
got garbled. Fixed that. Now there musn't be any lenght limitation for the
records of info files.

The configure script now checks if libcurl has SSL support enabled in
order to avoid MSN malfunctions. It requires libcurl with SSL, so just
provide the MSN module with it if you want to use it.

4.13.0
------

Centericq now builds fine with gcc 3.4.

A new command-line parameter, --debug, was added. This way, there is no need
anymore to re-build the program in order to enable debug output. However,
when using this mode, make sure you understand what it says in the log window
and in ~/.centericq/debug.

There are two passwords for an IRC account now. One is for Nickserv and
the other one is for regular IRC authentification, which wasn't
supported before.

Online and free-for-chat mode have the same priority now. So your [f]
contacts won't stay all the time in the top of the list anymore.

Unicode characters in rtf-encoded icq messages aren't lost anymore.
Instead, they are recoded into the primary charset. So now, for example,
Cyrillic sent with gnomeicu, won't disappear.

Segfault when accepting Yahoo! file transfers was fixed.

For online users, centericq now shown the time during which it sees
those contacts online. Check out the first page of user info for an
online contact.

Among the other stuff that didn't let me release .13 earlier was my
moving to Germany. Now I am in Berlin on permanent basis, so if you're
at the CCC congress that is to take place in a week, Konst can be met
there :)

4.14.0
------

Because of the mistake I made in the previous version, the 'u' letter was
eaten by the RTF parser when processing messages from windows icq clients.
It looked for unicode chars, but ate all 'u' characters it used to found.
Fixed that.

A memory leak problem when checking RSS was fixed.

Gadu-Gadu module used to produce a segfault when it was unable to obtain
a registration token from the server. Now it doesn't crash, though the
impossibility to register a new UIN is still there. The serve simply
doesn't find an appropriate document by the registration URL. Too bad.

Applied a small patch by Paul Chitescu so that it's now possible to start
centericq with all protocols set to offline.

Another type of external event was added. Now you can execute your actions
when someone goes offline. Hope someone finds that useful.

4.20.0
------

PGP encryption support was implemented for the Jabber module. In a nutshell
this means that with a proper setup your communications get a way more secure.
GPGME library is needed to build the PGP support.

Fixed the RTF parser that takes charge when a message from a Windows ICQ
client is received. One problem was that it used to treat backspace characters
wrong sometimes. Another problem with utf-16 was fixed with a patch submitted
by Vadim Nosovsky.

After ICQ dual login detection centericq used to try re-connecting, though it
wasn't supposed to. Fixed.

During a long time noone reported me the bug related to libicq2000's header
files getting installed each time "make install" was run for centericq. Finally
Wolfram Schlich noted this one, so I fixed it.

Logging on Yahoo! didn't work on Sun Sparc machines. Fixed that. That might
also revive Gadu-Gadu on bigendian architectures.

A couple of interface related bugs were fixed, such as a mistake in the group
organization dialog as well as not clearing pending messages for contacts in
non-chat communication mode.

4.21.0
------

AIM changed its protocol again, so all TOC clients did not work. This release
fixes the inability to connect to the AIM network.

Some Jabber bugs were fixed. PGP works better, and it's also possible to
connect to Google Talk. Ian Johannesen sent the patch for the latter.

Chat window cycling patch from Iulian Ciorascu was applied. Don't forget
to update your keybindings file if you want to use it. Simply add the
following two lines to it:
----
bind editor     \cn     next_chat
bind editor     \cb     prev_chat
----

Applied two patches from David Riebenbauer. One makes centericq change
Jabber status to unavailable before disconnecting, and adds coloring of
contacts according to the procotol (configurable from the configuration
dialog).

Since autoconf/automake authors finally started to maintain backward
compatibility, I've updated the cicqsync so that it uses the current
versions of the tools. The reason is that running specific versions for
better compatibility doesn't work anymore :)
