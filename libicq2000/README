libicq2000 is an opensource C++ library being developed to support the
icq2000/2001 protocol. It is easy for developers to use as the
backbone for their clients' connection to the ICQ network - all the
protocol work is abstracted away in one nice object-orientated
interface.

libicq2000 supports:
- Message sending/receiving
- URL sending/receiving
- SMS sending/receiving, including delivery reports
  (SMTP gateway delivery too)
- Status changes
- Authorisation Requests
- "You were added" messages
- Fetching user info from server (both basic and advanced)
- Fetching away messages
- Setting custom away messages
- Direct Connections
- Invisibility, including visible/invisible lists
- Ignore lists

See the TODO for information about planned features in
progress. Please don't duplicate requests for features already
mentioned in the TODO. Send legitimate feature requests to the
libicq2000-devel mailing list on sourceforge:
<libicq2000-devel@lists.sourceforge.net> (you don't need to
subscribe to post).

libicq2000 is in no way affiliated with 'ICQ' or 'Mirabilis'.

   ------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need:
* libstdc++ library (the standard C++ library)

Distribution   Packages required
------------   -----------------
Redhat 7.1     libstdc++-2.96-81.i386.rpm, libstdc++-devel-2.96-81.i386.rpm

Other          I'd appreciate any input from people on success/failures.
Redhats

For RPM distributions (Redhat, SuSE, etc..) - make sure you install
the 'development' RPMs for all these libraries as well. Usually these
are called library-devel.rpm or similar. I'm trying to build up a list
of the names of the rpms that are required, so send me info about what
you needed for your distribution if it's not already here.

Debian         libstdc++2.10 and libstdc++2.10-dev
(+ Progeny,
 etc..)        

Sources for these libraries can be found at the following addresses:
libstdc++: http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/libstdc++/ 
           (should have come with your version of gcc)

   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Compiling                                                      -
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

Generic configure instructions can be found in INSTALL. These are the
brief instructions for libicq2000:

1. Type './configure'

2. Type 'make' to compile the package

On some systems that don't have gmake as the default make you might
have to install and explicitly use that (usually named as gmake in
that case).

   - Installation                                                   -
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Type 'make install' as root to install the libraries.

Easy as that.

libicq2000 started life out as part of the gtk-- client
ickle. (http://ickle.sourceforge.net).

Since the 0.3.0 release of ickle, libicq2000 has been split off into
it's own release schedule, CVS tree and sourceforge project.

It was always designed to work as a separate library, it seemed now
that there was enough demand for it to warrant splitting development
off.

Known clients that use this library are:

* ickle - a gtkmm graphical client
  http://ickle.sourceforge.net/

* CenterICQ - a console client
  http://konst.org.ua/centericq/

* ICQv7-t - an ICQ transport for Jabber
  http://icqv7-t.sourceforge.net/

* IcyJuice - a Mac OS X graphical client

In the spirit of opensource libicq2000 is a community effort with
contributions welcomely accepted. If it's just a small patch for a bug
fix, or you are wishing to help out more big time in the development
please feel free to contribute.

I'd prefer patches and development related questions to go to the
sourceforge libicq20000-devel mailing list - so they can be seen by
all the developers rather than just me. I'd suggest subscribing,
although you can post even if you aren't subscribed.
<libicq2000-devel@users.sourceforge.net>

For submitting patches, please:

a) Make sure you are working on a recent checked out copy of the
   anonymous CVS, often the problem has been fixed already.

b) Follow code conventions in the layout of the code as it is at the
   moment.

c) Produce the diff by running 'cvs diff -uN > my-patch.diff'

d) Email the diff to <libicq2000-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>

I am happy to add developers to the sourceforge project, so they are
able to checkout CVS with write access and contribute directly back
into CVS. This will be a lot easier for both you and me in the long
run, rather than exchanging patches constantly.


   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Anonymous CVS                                                  -
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are interested in using libicq2000 with your client, I'd
recommend looking at the latest CVS:
http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=36654

The modulename is libicq2000. Once you have checked out the sources,
you must run the autogen.sh file to generate configure.

Beware though - the CVS is often unstable inbetween releases. Please
subscribe to the libicq2000-devel mailing list on sourceforge to stay
up to date on what is going on in CVS. You will also probably want to
subscribe to libicq2000-commits, so you can see what work is being
done on the source. If you find a problem in CVS please check back in
the archives for libicq2000-devel to check it hasn't already been
acknowledged/solved.

   - API                                                            -
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

You can find doxygen generated documentation on the libicq2000
homepage (the API link on the right).

The API should be more stable now, and I am aiming to avoid breaking
backward compatability in future as much as possible from now onwards.

The examples directory contains the shell example, which shows how to
use the library from the shell simply and how the socket callbacks
interact.

Other good sources of information are the ickle sourcecode, which
should support all the latest features of the API.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Comments, bug reports, etc..                                     -
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug reports and development related comments should be sent to:
  <libicq2000-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>
(You don't need to be subscribed to post to the list)

To keep up to date with the CVS subscribe to:
  <libicq2000-commits@lists.sourceforge.net>
This will automatically send you a brief summary of commits to CVS
when they are made.

You can send me mail to:
  <barnaby@beedesign.co.uk>
Although the list is the preferred option.

I am available on icq (ICQ# 12137587 Alias bee).
